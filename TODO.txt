- Remove a lot of methods that are no longer needed.

- The CLOptions code is horrible, rewrite the whole class.

- Think of a better way to fix random maps with even dimensions
  (maybe using dim as the number of corridors?, not very good
  for the empty style, though)

- The ServerSpec family is to complicated to use at the beginning of
  the course, think about how to simlify that.

- Write a cheat mode that draws the path from the current hero
  position to the exit. (WARNING think about how to do that for
  not-perfect mazes (empty and test).
