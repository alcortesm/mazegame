- Remove a lot of methods that are no longer needed.

- The CLOptions code is horrible, rewrite the whole class.

- Think of a better way to fix random maps with even dimensions
  (maybe using dim as the number of corridors?, not very good
  for the empty style, though)

- For big mazes (~101x101) the game plays too slow. Fix this. This
  probably is cause by rendering the whole maze every time, which is
  super nice for making a simple text client, but it is super
  inneficient for GUI clients.
