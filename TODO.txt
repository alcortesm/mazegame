- Remove a lot of methods that are no longer needed.

- The CLOptions code is horrible, rewrite the whole class.

- Think of a better way to fix random maps with even dimensions
  (maybe using dim as the number of corridors?, not very good
  for the empty style, though)

- The utils.graph package is ugly and a mess, rewrite it from scrach.
